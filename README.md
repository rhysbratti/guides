# Guides & Tutorials

## Still a work in progress!
Over time, I've made a few guides for my own benefit that cover some of the tools I use personally. I decided to spiff up the formatting a bit and give them a place to live on GitHub

### Directory so far:
#### Rclone guide - a great tool managing offsite backups
#### Telegram message guide - a quick and easy way to send messages from scripts
